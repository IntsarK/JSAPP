Welcome to The PokéCenter. 

Description
     This is a portfolio project that lets users explore and learn about different Pokémon. The website displays a list of Pokémon names, and when a user clicks on one, it shows details like the Pokémon’s name, type, image, and sometimes its height or weight. It uses a public Pokémon API to get the data. This site is great for Pokémon fans, beginners, or anyone curious about learning more about Pokémon in a fun and interactive way.
